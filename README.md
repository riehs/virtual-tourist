# Virtual Tourist

This project was created by Daniel Riehs as part of Udacity.com's iOS Developer Nanodegree program.

This app allows the user to drop pins on a map and pull up Flickr images associated with the pin locations. The images and locations are stored in Core Data.

Note: To run this app, you must first replace the API_KEY constant in the DownloadPhotos.swift file with a valid Flickr API key.
